        <br/><br/>
        I was a student at Coding Dojo where I spent 4 months learning the 
        fundamentals of full stack development in Python, Java, and Javascript (MERN). 
        <br/><br/>
        Through these experiences, I ad the opportunity to work with both small and
        large teams 
        I do my best work with ambitious teams who are proponents of better 
        human experiences, a better society and better futures for all of us.
        <br/><br/>
        I'm currently looking for a new role as a developer. <strong>Hire me?</strong>
      </p>
